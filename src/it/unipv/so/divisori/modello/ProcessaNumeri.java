 * Class representing an obejct using multiple threads to searche antiprime numbers in background.
 *
 * A request is stored in the 'request' member.  After each request 'toProcess' is initilized to the next integer to
 * evaluate as possible antiprime.  Similarly, 'processed' is set to the last number already analyzed.
 *
 * Multiple threads ask number to process and return asynchronously its count of divisors.  When a number with more
 * divisor than 'request' is found it is signaled as antiprime to the sequence object. At that point the search is
 * terminated.
